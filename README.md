🛳️ PRODIGY_DS_02 – Titanic Dataset Analysis (Power BI)
📌 Internship Task 02 – Titanic EDA with Power BI
As part of my internship with Prodigy Infotech, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset using Power BI. This task was focused on understanding the passenger data and visualizing survival patterns using interactive dashboards.

📊 Objectives:
Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset.

Perform EDA to uncover insights about survival based on gender, class, age, and other factors.

Create a Power BI dashboard to visually represent the findings.

📁 Files Included:
File Name	Description
Titanic_Analysis.pbix	Power BI file with all visuals and dashboard.
Titanic_Dataset.csv	The dataset used (from Kaggle).
README.md	Documentation with task overview and insights.

📈 Key Visuals Created:
Gender vs. Survival Rate

Class-wise Distribution

Age Distribution Histogram

Pie Chart for Survival Percentage

Bar Chart for Embarked Locations

Slicer Filters for Dynamic Exploration

🔍 Insights:
Females had a much higher survival rate than males.

1st Class passengers had better chances of survival.

Younger passengers (especially children) were more likely to survive.

Most passengers embarked from Southampton.

📌 Tools Used:
Microsoft Power BI

Kaggle Titanic Dataset (CSV)

🙏 Acknowledgment:
Thanks to Prodigy Infotech for this opportunity. This task enhanced my ability to turn raw data into meaningful insights using Power BI.
